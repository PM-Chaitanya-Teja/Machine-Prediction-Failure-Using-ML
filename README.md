#Machine Failure Prediction – Predictive Maintenance System
Machine Failure Prediction is a Python-based Machine Learning project designed to predict equipment breakdowns using sensor data. It helps in identifying potential failures early to reduce industrial downtime.

##Features
Data Cleaning & EDA: Analysis of sensor parameters like temperature and torque.
Failure Classification: Predicting if a machine will fail based on real-time inputs.
Feature Importance: Identifying which factors (e.g., tool wear or speed) lead to failure.
High Accuracy Model: Optimized to detect failures with high precision and recall.

##Technologies Used
Python
Machine Learning (Scikit-Learn)
Data Analysis (Pandas, NumPy)
Visualization (Matplotlib, Seaborn)

##How to Run
Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/yourusername/project-name.git
Install requirements: pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib
Run the project: Open the .ipynb file in Jupyter Notebook or run python main.py

##Note
Ensure the dataset file (e.g., predictive_maintenance.csv) is in the same directory as the script for the code to execute correctly.

##Project Type
Machine Learning Portfolio Project
